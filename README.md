## Introduction 
I'm a passionate learner who tries to hit every opportunity that comes my way to meet the best version of myself. I believe in finding creative and efficient solutions to problems and I’m a web development and coding enthusiast. I’m thorough with C/C++, Data Structures, Algorithms, and object-oriented programming concepts! Being a person who is always eager to learn new technologies, I'm giving my hands-on full stack development these days. I am also familiar with cloud computing and Google Cloud Platform and have hands-on experience with Qwiklabs. I'm highly dedicated, optimistic, and energetic! I’m also a team player and know how to improve myself when given feedback. Giving my best to whatever I do and doing it in a unique way with dedication is what makes me special. I am a quick learner and I can pick up new tech stacks easily. I'm also highly experienced at working in leadership and marketing positions. Being driven by the passion for giving back to the community, I’ve been an active part of 7 technical and 5 non-technical communities. I have got great experience in event management and public relations as I've organized 30+ online-offline events with some getting participation from all over the world. Recently, I've been selected as a Google Generation Scholar (Among 70 scholars selected across 16 countries in the APAC Region), Nutanix Women In Technology Scholar (One among 12 scholars selected from the US, France, India, Netherlands, and Serbia), and GHC Scholar for being committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion of the underrepresented section in the technical world. As someone who is highly focused, creative and attentive to detail, I thrive on giving results that surpass expectations.
